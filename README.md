# Lane Detection

This repository contains Python code for lane detection in images and videos using OpenCV.

### Requirements

- Python 
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Usage
#### Video Lane Detection

1. Run the `lane.py` script for lane detection in a video.
2. Replace video path in the script with the path to your desired input video.
3. Adjust parameters as necessary for video processing and lane detection.
4. Execute the script to display the video with detected lanes. Press 'q' to exit the video window.

### Files

- `lane.py`: Python script for lane detection in a video.
- `test6.png`: Sample input image for testing lane detection.
- `test6.mp4`: Sample input video for testing lane detection.

### Notes

- Ensure proper installation of required Python packages before running the scripts.
- Adjust parameters in the scripts based on specific image or video characteristics for accurate lane detection.
- The scripts provide visualizations for detected lanes, allowing adjustments for better performance.
